Microsoft 365 (MS-900) License-Olympics: Navigating the Jungle with Occam’s Razor

Microsoft 365. A product as versatile as it is dizzying. Anyone diving into the MS-900 exam quickly realizes that understanding licensing here is like playing 3D chess blindfolded—against yourself. But don’t worry, with a bit of sharp reasoning (and maybe a sarcastic metaphor or two), we’ll slice through the nonsense.

Look into the cave you’re about to get into:

Round One: Decoding the Question—Nope, This Isn’t a Trick
Every question in the MS-900 exam is deceptively simple—until it’s not. Take this gem:

Question 1: “Your company plans to migrate from on-premises services to a hybrid cloud environment. Which tool should you use to facilitate collaboration?”

A. Microsoft Office Delve
B. Microsoft SharePoint
C. Microsoft Yammer
D. Microsoft Teams
Correct Answer: B

Why? Well, Microsoft SharePoint offers hybrid cloud capabilities, and let’s face it: no one ever thought of Teams as a “file-sharing paradise.” SharePoint’s the one pulling its weight in this scenario—like that team member who actually does all the work in a group project but doesn’t get the credit. Just SharePoint things.

Round Two: Unpacking Legacy Applications – Is Your App an Antique?
Question 2: “Your organization is planning to migrate legacy applications to Microsoft 365. Which type of applications should be considered first?”

A. Applications that don’t need compliance measures
B. Applications that manage sensitive information
C. Applications that require USB-token access
D. All legacy applications or those that haven’t been updated in years
Correct Answer: D

Old, unpatched legacy apps are like grandma’s porcelain—fragile and dangerous in the wrong hands. These apps either need an upgrade, or they’ll break faster than a Millennial in a 90s trivia quiz. It’s best to handle them first, because old apps love causing trouble like it’s their job.

Round Three: Microsoft 365 Licensing – The Real-Life Jenga
When it comes to Microsoft licensing, you don’t need a degree in legalese (though it wouldn’t hurt). But here’s the thing—the right licensing is the difference between “nice and breezy” and “I want to flip my laptop.” The MS-900 exam will test how well you know this.

Preliminary Round: Time to Put Your License Hat On
The exam tests your ability to decide what tool fits best. To make it simple, when in doubt, go hybrid or cloud native. When licensing gets complex (and it will), Occam’s razor your way through it: cut the fluff, think logically, and if it feels too convoluted, you’ve probably overthought it.

Take these questions as exercises in minimalist thinking—MS-900 isn’t about memorizing trivia, it’s about finding the simplest, most effective solution in a sea of corporate jargon and acronyms. Just remember, fewer acronyms, fewer headaches.

Round Four: The Identity Rollercoaster – Multi-Factor Magic
Question 4: “Which of the following enhances security when accessing Microsoft 365 by requiring more than one form of verification?”

A. Microsoft Defender for Identity
B. Microsoft Defender for Cloud
C. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
D. Azure Active Directory
Correct Answer: C

Who doesn’t love a good security hurdle before accessing your email, right? If you’re not a fan of phishing attacks (and let’s hope you’re not), MFA is the bouncer standing outside the club that’s your Microsoft 365 account. One password? Ha! We scoff in the face of single-factor security. MFA is your virtual doorman, adding that extra layer of “you shall not pass” to cyber threats.

Round Five: Office 365 Apps vs. Microsoft 365 Apps – What’s the Difference Again?
Question 5: “Which app suite includes both cloud-based and on-premises productivity apps for your business?”

A. Office 365
B. Microsoft 365
C. Dynamics 365
D. None of the above
Correct Answer: B

It’s a bit like the classic, “Is this a sandwich or is it a wrap?” scenario. Microsoft 365 includes everything that Office 365 has but throws in some extra cloud goodness and enterprise-level tools. Think of Office 365 as your basic productivity suite, but Microsoft 365? That’s the whole buffet.

Round Six: The Cloud vs. Hybrid Dilemma
Question 6: “You are considering moving some workloads to the cloud, but also want to retain certain on-premises capabilities. What’s your best option?”

A. Full cloud migration
B. Hybrid environment
C. Keep everything on-premises
D. Use only SaaS applications
Correct Answer: B

This one’s easy: hybrid is like hedging your bets. Can’t let go of those on-prem servers? Want to enjoy the perks of the cloud but not fully commit? Hybrid’s your Goldilocks option. Not too hot, not too cold, just right.

Round Seven: Say It with Me—Compliance is Not Boring
Question 7: “Which of these is a compliance-related feature in Microsoft 365?”

A. Microsoft Teams
B. Information Governance
C. Yammer
D. Planner

A. Microsoft 365 E5

C. Microsoft 365 Business Standard
D. Office 365 E3
Correct Answer: C

Business Standard is your middle-of-the-road, “I don’t need Fort Knox, but I also don’t want to skimp on security” option. It gets the job done without breaking the bank or your brain.

Question 13: “Which feature prevents sensitive information from being shared externally in Microsoft 365?”

A. Microsoft Planner
B. Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
