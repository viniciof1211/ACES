You need to design an Azure backup solution. Which strategy should you implement for data protection?;Georeliant backup storage solutions;Fast recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives;Backup to a secondary Azure region;Full archive and restore capability;C;The correct strategy for Azure backup solutions, especially for disaster recovery and business continuity, is to implement a backup to a secondary Azure region. Azure offers geo-redundant storage (GRS) and read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) that ensure your data is replicated in a secondary Azure region, providing robust protection against data loss. This strategy ensures cross-region replication of data, allowing recovery from a disaster affecting the primary region. The key elements include: - **Geo-Redundancy**: Data is copied to a secondary region, providing high availability and durability. - **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Defines the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. With a secondary region backup, the RPO can be minimized to minutes. - **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Defines how quickly services can be restored. Azure backup solutions minimize RTO by leveraging fast recovery times. - **Encryption and Compliance**: Data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, and meets various regulatory requirements for compliance. This approach provides a robust disaster recovery strategy, ensuring business continuity in the event of regional outages or failures. More details can be found in the official documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-overview

What is the purpose of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM)?;To manage user identities;To provide data encryption;To manage and control access to privileged roles;To monitor network traffic;C;Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a service within Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) designed to help organizations manage, control, and monitor access to important resources. Specifically, PIM provides just-in-time (JIT) access to privileged roles, enabling users to activate roles only when necessary, and automatically deactivating them when not in use. This drastically reduces the risk of permanent over-privileged access that attackers could exploit. PIM allows organizations to configure policies that enforce specific criteria, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), just-in-time role activation, and approval workflows before granting access to sensitive resources. It also provides comprehensive logging and alerting, enabling real-time tracking of role activations and monitoring of any changes made during privileged sessions. By controlling and auditing access to Azure AD roles (such as Global Administrator or Security Administrator) and other Azure resources, PIM helps organizations adhere to the principle of least privilege, an essential component in any security strategy. It is a critical tool for reducing insider threats and protecting against external attacks that might exploit overly permissive access.

Which of the following is a key feature of Azure Virtual Network;Network Security Groups (NSGs);Virtual Network Peering;Blob Storage;Azure Active Directory;B;Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a foundational service in Azure, providing several critical networking features that enable communication between Azure resources and with on-premises networks. One of the key features is "Virtual Network Peering," which allows two Azure VNets to connect seamlessly, enabling resources in different VNets to communicate with each other. This feature provides low-latency, high-bandwidth communication without the need for complex networking setups, such as VPNs or gateways. Virtual Network Peering helps organizations efficiently manage hybrid or multi-region deployments and ensure scalability. Peered networks can share resources while still maintaining security through separate address spaces. It is often used to facilitate the communication between application components deployed across multiple VNets within a single or across multiple Azure regions. By enabling VNet Peering, organizations can optimize performance, reduce costs associated with gateway devices, and improve overall network architecture design.
