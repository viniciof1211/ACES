Question;OptionA;OptionB;OptionC;OptionD;CorrectAnswer;Explanation
When you are implementing a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution  you are responsible for;configuring high availability.;defining scalability rules.;installing the SaaS solution.;configuring the SaaS solution.;D;In a SaaS model  the user is typically only responsible for configuring the SaaS solution to meet their specific needs. The cloud provider manages all other aspects including high availability  scalability  and installation. SaaS offers the least amount of management for the end user  with the provider handling the underlying infrastructure  middleware  and software. Users simply access and use the software  usually through a web browser  on a pay-as-you-go basis. This allows organizations to utilize sophisticated software solutions without the complexity of installation  maintenance  and infrastructure management.
You have an on-premises network that contains several servers. You plan to migrate all the servers to Azure. You need to recommend a solution to ensure that some of the servers are available if a single Azure data center goes offline for an extended period. What should you include in the recommendation?;fault tolerance Most Voted;elasticity;scalability;low latency;A;Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue to function in the event of a failure of some of its components. In this question  you could have servers that are replicated across datacenters. Availability zones expand the level of control you have to maintain the availability of the applications and data on your VMs. Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power  cooling  and networking. To ensure resiliency  there are a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions. The physical separation of Availability Zones within a region protects applications and data from datacenter failures. With Availability Zones  Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA. By architecting your solutions to use replicated VMs in zones  you can protect your applications and data from the loss of a datacenter. If one zone is compromised  then replicated apps and data are instantly available in another zone.

An organization that hosts its infrastructure in  _______________ no longer requires a data center.;in a private cloud;in a hybrid cloud;in the public cloud;on a Hyper-V host;C;A private cloud is hosted in your datacenter. Therefore  you cannot close your datacenter if you are using a private cloud. A public cloud is hosted externally  for example  in Microsoft Azure. An organization that hosts its infrastructure in a public cloud can close its data center. Public cloud is the most common deployment model. In this case  you have no local hardware to manage or keep up-to-date – everything runs on your cloud provider's hardware. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud provider. Public cloud In a private cloud  you create a cloud environment in your own datacenter and provide self-service access to compute resources to users in your organization. This offers a simulation of a public cloud to your users  but you remain completely responsible for the purchase and maintenance of the hardware and software services you provide.

Your company is planning to migrate all their virtual machines to an Azure pay-as-you-go subscription. The virtual machines are currently hosted on the Hyper-V hosts in a data center. You are required make sure that the intended Azure solution uses the correct expenditure model. Solution: You should recommend the use of the elastic expenditure model. Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Not enough info;Ambiguous scenario;B;The recommendation to use the elastic spending model to migrate virtual machines to a prepaid Azure subscription is not appropriate. The term 'elastic spending' is not a common description for an Azure cost model. For a migration to Azure with a prepaid subscription you usually choose the resource purchase model that best suits your company's needs such as Pay-As-You-Go Enterprise Contract or others. The actual spending model depends on how your company plans to pay for Azure services. Therefore the correct answer depends on the specific cost model chosen within the prepaid subscription and the description 'elastic spending' is not a standard term in this context. It is recommended that you analyse and choose the Azure cost model that best meets your company's financial and operational needs.
Your company is planning to migrate all their virtual machines to an Azure pay-as-you-go subscription. The virtual machines are currently hosted on the Hyper-V hosts in a data center. You are required make sure that the intended Azure solution uses the correct expenditure model. Solution: You should recommend the use of the scalable expenditure model. Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Not enough info;Ambiguous scenario;B;Because we have two expenditure models. One is CapEx and another is OpEx. So Scalable Expenditure IS NOT the right answer. Operating expenditures are ongoing costs of doing business. Consuming cloud services in a pay-as-you-go model could qualify as an operating expenditure:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes/fiscal-outcomes/    -----  SCALABLE: environments only care about increasing capacity to accommodate an increasing workload. ELASTIC: environments care about being able to meet current demands without under/over provisioning in an autonomic fashion. There is no such thing as a Scalable Expenditure Model in Azure. The two expenditure models in Azure are Pay-as-you-Go and Reserved Instances. Pay-as-you-go is the default and most common expenditure model in Azure. It means you pay for resources you consume on an hourly or per-minute basis. It offers flexibility to scale resources up and down as needed. ** RESERVED INSTANCES is an expenditure model where you commit to a one or three-year term for a particular virtual machine instance type size and region. This commitment provides you with a discount compared to pay-as-you-go pricing. Since the question states that the company is planning to migrate all of their virtual machines to an Azure pay-as-you-go subscription the correct expenditure model is pay-as-you-go (PAYG).

Your company's Active Directory forest includes thousands of user accounts. You have been informed that all network resources will be migrated to Azure. Thereafter the on-premises data center will be retired. You are required to employ a strategy that reduces the effect on users once the planned migration has been completed. Solution: You plan to sync all the Active Directory user accounts to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Not enough info;Ambiguous scenario;A;Syncing all the Active Directory user accounts to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a common strategy to ensure a smooth migration to the cloud while minimizing the impact on users. This approach is often referred to as implementing a hybrid identity model. By syncing the user accounts to Azure AD using tools like Azure AD Connect -- users can continue using their existing credentials to access cloud resources after the migration. This provides a seamless experience for users and reduces the disruption typically associated with migrations. Therefore => the solution of syncing Active Directory user accounts to Azure AD meets the goal of reducing the impact on users during the migration to Azure.

With Availability Zones  Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA. This requires a minimum of 2VMs and 2 AZ's. Anything less would give 99.95% availability. A VM can't be assigned to more than 1 AZ as doing so will create "n" VMs in each selected AZ.
You are tasked with deploying a critical LOB (Line-Of-Business) application  which will be installed on a virtual machine  to Azure. You are informed that the application deployment strategy should allow for a guaranteed availability of 99.99 percent. You need to make sure that the strategy requires as little virtual machines and availability zones as possible. Solution: You include two virtual machines and two availability zones in your strategy. Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Not enough info;Ambiguous scenario;A;Deploying two virtual machines across two availability zones can meet the goal of achieving 99.99% availability. Here’s why => Availability Zones: Using two availability zones provides high availability by ensuring that if one zone experiences a failure  the other zone can continue to operate  thereby reducing the risk of total service disruption. Virtual Machines: With two virtual machines spread across these availability zones  you achieve redundancy and fault tolerance. If one virtual machine fails  the other can handle the workload  ensuring continuous operation. This setup meets the requirements for high availability with minimal resource use  aligning with the goal of 99.99% availability.
Your company's developers intend to deploy a large number of custom virtual machines on a weekly basis. They will also be removing these virtual machines during the same week it was deployed. Sixty percent of the virtual machines have Windows Server 2016 installed  while the other forty percent has Ubuntu Linux installed. You are required to make sure that the administrative effort  needed for this process  is reduced by employing a suitable Azure service. Solution: You recommend the use of Microsoft Managed Desktop. Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Not enough info;Ambiguous scenario;B;The correct solution should be Azure DevTest Labs because it was mentioned that developers intend to deploy and remove VMs in the same week. Keyword is developers and deploy and remove. Most probably is it the test environment. So DevTest is correct answer and more relevant to this scenario.
Your company's developers intend to deploy a large number of custom virtual machines on a weekly basis. They will also be removing these virtual machines during the same week it was deployed. Sixty percent of the virtual machines have Windows Server 2016 installed  while the other forty percent has Ubuntu Linux installed. You are required to make sure that the administrative effort  needed for this process  is reduced by employing a suitable Azure service. Solution: You recommend the use of Azure Reserved Virtual Machines (VM) Instances. Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Not enough info;Ambiguous scenario;B;Azure Reserved Virtual Machine (VM) Instances are not the most suitable solution for deploying and managing a large number of custom virtual machines on a weekly basis that are also removed during the same week. Reserved VM Instances are used to save costs by committing to a specific VM instance type for a one- or three-year term  which is not aligned with the short-term and frequent deployment and removal pattern described in your scenario. To reduce administrative effort for your specific use case  you might consider using Azure DevTest Labs. Azure DevTest Labs allows you to quickly create environments in Azure while managing costs by setting up policies for resource usage. You can create a lab that aligns with your requirements  including Windows Server and Ubuntu Linux VMs  and allow your developers to deploy and remove VMs easily in a controlled environment. Therefore  the solution of using Azure Reserved VM Instances does not meet the goal of reducing administrative effort for deploying and managing a large number of custom virtual machines on a weekly basis that are also removed within the same week.

You have been informed by your superiors of the company's intentions to automate server deployment to Azure. There is  however  some concern that administrative credentials could be uncovered during this process. You are required to make sure that during the deployment  the administrative credentials are encrypted using a suitable Azure solution. Solution: You recommend the use of Azure Information Protection. Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Not enough info;Ambiguous scenario;B;Azure Information Protection (AIP) is a cloud-based solution that enables organizations to discover  classify  and protect documents and emails by applying labels to content. Thus  it's not designed to encrypt management credentials during server deployment. For encrypting administrative credentials during server deployment to Azure  a more suitable solution would be to use Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that allows you to safeguard cryptographic keys  certificates  and secrets used by cloud applications and services. You can store the administrative credentials securely in Azure Key Vault and retrieve them when needed during the deployment process. This ensures that the credentials are properly protected and managed.

Which cloud deployment solution is used for Azure virtual machines and Azure SQL databases? To answer  select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.;Infrastructure as a service (IaaS);Platform as a service (PaaS);Managed Service;Serverless Computing;A;Azure virtual machines are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Infrastructure as a Service is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you complete control over the hardware that runs your application (IT infrastructure servers and virtual machines (VMs)  storage  networks  and operating systems). Instead of buying hardware  with IaaS  you rent it. Azure SQL databases are Platform as a Service (PaaS). Azure SQL Database is a fully managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) Database Engine that handles most of the database management functions such as upgrading  patching  backups  and monitoring without user involvement. Azure SQL Database is always running on the latest stable version of SQL Server Database Engine and patched OS with 99.99% availability. PaaS capabilities that are built-in into Azure SQL database enable you to focus on the domain specific database administration and optimization activities that are critical for your business.

Your company hosts an accounting application named App1 that is used by all the customers of the company. App1 has low usage during the first three weeks of each month and very high usage during the last week of each month. Which benefit of Azure Cloud Services supports cost management for this type of usage pattern?;high availability;high latency;cost predictability;resource allocation;C;Elasticity in this case is the ability to provide additional compute resource when needed and reduce the compute resource when not needed to reduce costs. Autoscaling is an example of elasticity. Elastic computing is the ability to quickly expand or decrease computer processing  memory and storage resources to meet changing demands without worrying about capacity planning and engineering for peak usage. Typically controlled by system monitoring tools  elastic computing matches the amount of resources allocated to the amount of resources actually needed without disrupting operations. With cloud elasticity  a company avoids paying for unused capacity or idle resources and doesn't have to worry about investing in the purchase or maintenance of additional resources and equipment.

You have an on-premises network that contains 100 servers. You need to recommend a solution that provides additional resources to your users. The solution must minimize capital and operational expenditure costs. What should you include in the recommendation?;a complete migration to the public cloud;an additional data center;public cloud only;dedicated servers;D;A hybrid cloud is a combination of a private cloud and a public cloud. Capital expenditure is the spending of money up-front for infrastructure such as new servers. With a hybrid cloud  you can continue to use the on-premises servers while adding new servers in the public cloud (Azure for example). Adding new servers in Azure minimizes the capital expenditure costs as you are not paying for new servers as you would if you deployed new server on-premises. Incorrect Answers: A: A complete migration of 100 servers to the public cloud would involve a lot of operational expenditure (the cost of migrating all the servers). B: An additional data center would involve a lot of capital expenditure (the cost of the new infrastructure). C: A private cloud is hosted on on-premises servers to this would involve a lot of capital expenditure (the cost of the new infrastructure to host the private cloud).

For each of the following statements  select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise  select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.;To achieve a hybrid cloud model  a company must always migrate from a private cloud model.;A company can extend the capacity of its internal network by using the public cloud.;Only guest users can access resources in the cloud.;Only external users can access resources in the cloud.;B;It is not true that a company must always migrate from a private cloud model to implement a hybrid cloud. You could start with a public cloud and then combine that with an on-premise infrastructure to implement a hybrid cloud. A company can extend the capacity of its internal network by using the public cloud. This is very common. When you need more capacity  rather than pay out for new on-premises infrastructure  you can configure a cloud environment and connect your on-premises network to the cloud environment by using a VPN. It is not true that only guest users can access cloud resources. You can give anyone with an account in Azure Active Directory access to the cloud resources. There are many authentication scenarios but a common one is to replicate your on-premises Active Directory accounts to Azure Active Directory and provide access to the Azure Active Directory accounts. Another commonly used authentication method is 'Federation' where authentication for access to cloud resources is passed to another authentication provider such as an on-premises Active Directory. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/overview/what-is-hybrid-cloud-computing/

You can assign a: _________ to every Azure Resource;blueprint;lock;policy;service endpoint;B;Locks can be assigned to every Azure resource to prevent either accidental deletion or creation of resources inside a resource group.
Your company plans to migrate all its data and resources to Azure. The company's migration plan states that only Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions must be used in Azure. You need to deploy an Azure environment that meets the company's migration plan. What should you create?;Azure virtual machines  Azure SQL databases  and Azure Storage accounts.;an Azure App Service and Azure virtual machines that have Microsoft SQL Server installed.;an Azure App Service and Azure SQL databases.;Azure storage accounts and web server in Azure virtual machines.;C;Azure App Service and Azure SQL databases are examples of Azure PaaS solutions. Platform as a Service (PaaS) enables organizations to deploy their applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. Azure App Service is a fully managed PaaS for web applications  and Azure SQL Database is a relational database service built on PaaS  both of which fulfill the company's requirement to use only PaaS solutions. IaaS solutions like Azure Virtual Machines and Azure Storage Accounts  on the other hand  do not meet this requirement as they involve management of the underlying infrastructure.
