Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Assign SharePoint permissions;Configure Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) rules;B;The solution does not meet the goal. While enrolling devices in Microsoft Intune provides mobile device management and security features it does not directly guarantee the availability of OneDrive for Business data. OneDrive synchronization and proper configuration are required for remote data availability not just device management through Intune.
You have deployed Windows 10 devices using Windows Autopilot in your organization. You are tasked with ensuring that users can access data stored in OneDrive for Business from remote locations. Solution: You inform users that they should sign in using their Microsoft Azure AD credentials. Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Set up OneDrive sync policies;Configure SharePoint Online Conditional Access Policies;B;This solution does not meet the goal. While Azure AD credentials enable authentication and access to Office 365 services it does not specifically address ensuring data availability in OneDrive. Data synchronization and conditional access policies must be configured to enable proper remote access to OneDrive files.
You have used Windows Autopilot to deploy devices across your enterprise and now you're required to ensure OneDrive for Business data is accessible remotely. Solution: You configure Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) to monitor OneDrive traffic. Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Deploy Microsoft Endpoint DLP;Enable SharePoint Online Public Sharing;D;This solution does not meet the goal. While MCAS is excellent for monitoring and securing cloud applications including OneDrive it does not directly influence the availability of data for remote users.

You have recently made use of Windows Autopilot to deploy Windows 10 devices in your company's environment. You have been asked to make sure that data stored in OneDrive for Business is available to users from remote locations. Solution: You inform users that they should use their Microsoft Azure AD credentials to sign in to their devices. Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Configure OneDrive policies via SharePoint admin center;Set up private network access for OneDrive;A;This solution meets the goal. By using Microsoft Azure AD credentials you are ensuring that users are authenticated into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem allowing them to access services like OneDrive for Business. Azure AD handles the authentication and identity management for these services making it possible to access OneDrive from remote locations. However additional configuration like Known Folder Move (KFM) and ensuring the OneDrive client is installed may enhance this further.
You deployed Windows 10 devices using Autopilot. You need to ensure that users can access OneDrive for Business from remote locations. Solution: You only enroll the devices in Microsoft Intune. Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Deploy SharePoint Online custom access policies;Use Azure AD Conditional Access rules;B;The solution does not meet the goal. Although Microsoft Intune helps with device management and configuration it does not inherently guarantee the availability of OneDrive for Business files remotely. For full remote data access OneDrive needs proper setup and configuration such as enabling synchronization and Known Folder Move (KFM). Simply enrolling in Intune without addressing OneDrive configurations is insufficient.
Your organization has been using Windows Autopilot for device deployment. You need to make sure that OneDrive for Business data is accessible to users who are working remotely. Solution: You configure Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) to monitor OneDrive traffic. Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Enable hybrid identity with Azure AD Connect;Install OneDrive sync client via Intune;D;This solution does not meet the goal. MCAS is designed for monitoring and securing cloud applications but does not directly affect the availability of OneDrive data for remote users. To ensure remote access OneDrive needs to be properly configured for synchronization and policies must be set in place for data to be available remotely. MCAS can provide insights into the security of access but not the core availability of files in OneDrive.
