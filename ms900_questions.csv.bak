However  additional configuration like Known Folder Move (KFM) and ensuring the OneDrive client is installed may enhance this further.
You deployed Windows 10 devices using Autopilot. You need to ensure that users can access OneDrive for Business from remote locations. Solution: You only enroll the devices in Microsoft Intune. Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Deploy SharePoint Online custom access policies;Use Azure AD Conditional Access rules;B;The solution does not meet the goal. Although Microsoft Intune helps with device management and configuration  it does not inherently guarantee the availability of OneDrive for Business files remotely. For full remote data access  OneDrive needs proper setup and configuration  such as enabling synchronization and Known Folder Move (KFM). Simply enrolling in Intune without addressing OneDrive configurations is insufficient.
Your organization has been using Windows Autopilot for device deployment. You need to make sure that OneDrive for Business data is accessible to users who are working remotely. Solution: You configure Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) to monitor OneDrive traffic. Does the solution meet the goal?;Yes;No;Enable hybrid identity with Azure AD Connect;Install OneDrive sync client via Intune;D;This solution does not meet the goal. MCAS is designed for monitoring and securing cloud applications but does not directly affect the availability of OneDrive data for remote users. To ensure remote access  OneDrive needs to be properly configured for synchronization  and policies must be set in place for data to be available remotely.
