You need to identify which Microsoft platform provides hybrid capabilities for migrating from an on-premises deployment of email and calendaring systems. Which platform provides hybrid capabilities for migration?;Microsoft Skype for Business;Microsoft Yammer;Microsoft Exchange;Microsoft Teams;C;Microsoft Exchange provides hybrid capabilities, allowing organizations to integrate their on-premises Exchange environments with Exchange Online. This hybrid setup enables a seamless migration path for email and calendaring systems, maintaining user experience and functionality throughout the transition to the cloud.
You are tasked with migrating your organization's collaboration and communication tools from an on-premises solution. Which Microsoft platform provides hybrid capabilities for a seamless transition?;Microsoft Skype for Business;Microsoft Yammer;Microsoft Exchange;Microsoft Teams;D;Microsoft Teams supports hybrid deployment by allowing integration between existing on-premises communication systems and cloud-based Teams services. This hybrid approach ensures minimal disruption during migration, allowing continued collaboration and communication while transitioning to a fully cloud-based environment. In addition, ensures that collaboration and communication tools are accessible both during and after the migration, which is not something Skype for Business, Yammer, or Exchange can fully support in the same way. Also, Skype for Business used to be a popular communication tool, but it has been gradually replaced by Teams as the primary communication platform. Skype for Business provided instant messaging, voice, and video communication, but its hybrid deployment options are more limited compared to Teams. Microsoft has encouraged organizations to migrate from Skype for Business to Teams, as it lacks the comprehensive, modern integration capabilities of Teams.
