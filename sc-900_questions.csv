An organization has deployed Microsoft 365 applications to all employees. Considering the shared responsibility model, who is responsible for the accounts and identities relating to these employees?;The organization.;Microsoft, the SaaS provider.;There's shared responsibility between an organization and Microsoft.;The CSP takes full responsibility;A;In the shared responsibility model, organizations always retain responsibility for managing their accounts, identities, and access controls, even when using SaaS services like Microsoft 365. Microsoft provides the underlying infrastructure, software, and platform security, but the customer is responsible for ensuring that accounts and user identities are secure. This includes tasks like enforcing password policies, configuring multifactor authentication, and monitoring for unusual login behaviors. Microsoft provides tools for identity protection, but the organization must implement and manage them. The customerâ€™s responsibility extends to protecting data, devices, and user identities, ensuring secure access and permissions are correctly configured.
Which of the following measures might an organization implement as part of the defense in-depth security methodology?;Locating all its servers in a single physical location.;Multifactor authentication for all users.;Ensuring there's no segmentation of your corporate network.;Setup a single layer to bypass inbound requests;B;Defense in-depth is a layered security approach where multiple layers of defense are implemented to protect an organization's resources. One of the key layers of this methodology is identity security, where multifactor authentication (MFA) plays a critical role. By requiring multiple forms of verification before granting access, MFA makes it harder for unauthorized individuals to access systems, even if passwords are compromised. The other options providedâ€”like having all servers in a single location or no network segmentationâ€”would actually reduce security, making the organization more vulnerable to attacks. Proper segmentation and multiple defensive layers are essential to minimize vulnerabilities and limit the damage in case of a breach.
The human resources organization wants to ensure that stored employee data is encrypted. Which security mechanism would they use?;Hashing.;Encryption in transit.;Encryption at rest.;Deserialization;C;Encryption at rest refers to encrypting data while it's stored, such as on hard drives or in cloud storage. This is essential for protecting sensitive information like employee data from unauthorized access. Even if an attacker gains access to the physical storage or server, encryption at rest ensures that the data is unreadable without the correct encryption keys. In this case, the HR department would use encryption at rest to protect employee data. Hashing, on the other hand, is used for integrity verification rather than encryption, and encryption in transit protects data as it is being transferred over networks. Deserialization is unrelated to this context and refers to converting data formats.
Which of the following best describes the concept of data sovereignty?;There are regulations that govern the physical locations where data can be stored and how and when it can be transferred, processed, or accessed internationally.;Data, particularly personal data, is subject to the laws and regulations of the country/region in which it's physically collected, held, or processed.;Trust no one, verify everything.;Verify every single inbound and outbout request per port in the segmented network;B;Data sovereignty refers to the idea that data, especially personal data, is subject to the laws and regulations of the country or region in which it is stored, processed, or collected. This means that organizations must ensure compliance with local data protection laws when handling data in different jurisdictions. For example, the European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes strict requirements on how personal data can be transferred across borders, stored, and accessed. Option A partially explains the concept, but option B is more precise in defining data sovereignty as being regulated by local laws. The other options (C and D) reference security models and network verification strategies, which are unrelated to data sovereignty.
