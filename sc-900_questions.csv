As more business data is being accessed from locations outside of the traditional corporate network, security and compliance have become overriding concerns. How can organizations protect their data when it’s accessed from both on-premises and the cloud?;Use encryption and data masking;Implement firewall rules and DDoS protection;Apply security policies based on defense in-depth principles;Control access through perimeter security only;A;Organizations can protect data by implementing encryption and data masking technologies across both cloud and on-premises environments. Encryption ensures that sensitive data remains confidential even if it is intercepted.
As more business data is being accessed from locations outside of the traditional corporate network, security and compliance have become overriding concerns. Which approach can ensure security even when employees work remotely?;Zero Trust model;On-premises access control;Perimeter defense only;VPN tunnels;A;The Zero Trust model assumes that every request, both within and outside the network, must be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted to ensure security. This approach is especially important as more employees work remotely or access data from outside the traditional corporate perimeter.
How do encryption and hashing contribute to data protection?;Encryption scrambles data for secure transmission, and hashing verifies data integrity;Hashing hides data content while encryption scrambles it for secure transmission;Both encryption and hashing encrypt data for storage;Hashing is used for encryption of sensitive passwords, while encryption scrambles full databases;A;Encryption transforms data into unreadable formats, securing it during transmission, while hashing produces a fixed-length representation of data used to verify its integrity without revealing its content.
Describe the shared responsibility and defense in-depth security models in cloud environments.;Cloud provider manages data security and compliance;Customer retains full responsibility for data;Responsibility is shared between the customer and cloud provider based on service model;Security is managed only by the cloud provider;C;In cloud environments, the shared responsibility model divides responsibilities between the cloud provider and the customer. For IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, the customer always retains responsibility for data, identities, and devices.
How does the Zero-Trust model change traditional network security approaches?;By verifying every request, both inside and outside the network perimeter;By enhancing firewall rules for internal traffic;By ensuring a strong perimeter defense only;By using security zones within the network;A;The Zero-Trust model assumes that threats can come from both inside and outside the network. As a result, it requires continuous verification of every access request regardless of its origin.
What is the role of compliance frameworks in cloud security?;They ensure customers set up proper encryption rules;They guide organizations in meeting industry and regulatory requirements;They define the firewall and perimeter defense policies for cloud providers;They limit the cloud provider's security responsibilities to physical infrastructure;B;Compliance frameworks help organizations align with legal and regulatory standards, ensuring the protection and privacy of sensitive data, whether hosted on-premises or in the cloud.
In cloud environments, who retains full responsibility for protecting information and data?;The customer always retains full responsibility for information and data;The cloud provider retains full responsibility for all data management;Responsibility is shared depending on the service model;Data security is handled entirely by the service provider;A;In any cloud service model (SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS), the customer always retains full responsibility for securing their own information and data. This is a core tenet of the shared responsibility model.
How does defense in-depth ensure robust cloud security?;By layering multiple security defenses to protect systems and data;By focusing only on perimeter firewalls;By ensuring only physical security of cloud resources;By outsourcing security management to third-party providers;A;Defense in-depth is a multi-layered security strategy that uses a series of defenses, including network security, identity management, and data encryption, to protect data and systems from internal and external threats.
On-premises datacenters require organizations to manage which security aspects?;Everything from physical security to encrypting data;Only data encryption and identity management;Firewall rules and OS patching only;Only security of physical components;A;In on-premises datacenters, organizations must manage all aspects of security, from physical security measures to securing the network, operating systems, and data.
In a SaaS model, what is the customer responsible for managing?;Data, identities, devices, and some application settings;Network controls, operating systems, and data encryption;Operating systems and patch management;Physical security of datacenters;A;In the SaaS model, the customer is responsible for securing their data, identities, and devices. The cloud provider manages most other aspects, such as operating systems and infrastructure.
Which cloud model requires the customer to manage applications, data, and network controls but not the physical hardware?;Platform as a Service (PaaS);Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS);Software as a Service (SaaS);On-premises;B;In the IaaS model, customers manage the applications, data, and network controls, but the cloud provider manages the underlying physical infrastructure like servers and storage.
In the PaaS model, which responsibilities are retained by the cloud customer?;Management of applications and data;Management of physical infrastructure and security;Management of operating systems and network controls;Management of virtual machines and hypervisors;A;In the PaaS model, the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and operating systems, while the customer is responsible for managing their applications and data.
Which cloud service model requires the least management by the cloud customer?;Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS);Platform as a Service (PaaS);Software as a Service (SaaS);On-premises;C;SaaS requires the least management by the cloud customer since the cloud provider manages everything except data, devices, accounts, and identities.
An organization has deployed Microsoft 365 applications to all employees. Considering the shared responsibility model, who is responsible for the accounts and identities relating to these employees?;The organization.;Microsoft, the SaaS provider.;There's shared responsibility between an organization and Microsoft.;The CSP takes full responsibility;A;In the shared responsibility model, organizations always retain responsibility for managing their accounts, identities, and access controls, even when using SaaS services like Microsoft 365. Microsoft provides the underlying infrastructure, software, and platform security, but the customer is responsible for ensuring that accounts and user identities are secure. This includes tasks like enforcing password policies, configuring multifactor authentication, and monitoring for unusual login behaviors. Microsoft provides tools for identity protection, but the organization must implement and manage them. The customer’s responsibility extends to protecting data, devices, and user identities, ensuring secure access and permissions are correctly configured.
Which of the following measures might an organization implement as part of the defense in-depth security methodology?;Locating all its servers in a single physical location.;Multifactor authentication for all users.;Ensuring there's no segmentation of your corporate network.;Setup a single layer to bypass inbound requests;B;Defense in-depth is a layered security approach where multiple layers of defense are implemented to protect an organization's resources. One of the key layers of this methodology is identity security, where multifactor authentication (MFA) plays a critical role. By requiring multiple forms of verification before granting access, MFA makes it harder for unauthorized individuals to access systems, even if passwords are compromised. The other options provided—like having all servers in a single location or no network segmentation—would actually reduce security, making the organization more vulnerable to attacks. Proper segmentation and multiple defensive layers are essential to minimize vulnerabilities and limit the damage in case of a breach.
The human resources organization wants to ensure that stored employee data is encrypted. Which security mechanism would they use?;Hashing.;Encryption in transit.;Encryption at rest.;Deserialization;C;Encryption at rest refers to encrypting data while it's stored, such as on hard drives or in cloud storage. This is essential for protecting sensitive information like employee data from unauthorized access. Even if an attacker gains access to the physical storage or server, encryption at rest ensures that the data is unreadable without the correct encryption keys. In this case, the HR department would use encryption at rest to protect employee data. Hashing, on the other hand, is used for integrity verification rather than encryption, and encryption in transit protects data as it is being transferred over networks. Deserialization is unrelated to this context and refers to converting data formats.
Which of the following best describes the concept of data sovereignty?;There are regulations that govern the physical locations where data can be stored and how and when it can be transferred, processed, or accessed internationally.;Data, particularly personal data, is subject to the laws and regulations of the country/region in which it's physically collected, held, or processed.;Trust no one, verify everything.;Verify every single inbound and outbout request per port in the segmented network;B;Data sovereignty refers to the idea that data, especially personal data, is subject to the laws and regulations of the country or region in which it is stored, processed, or collected. This means that organizations must ensure compliance with local data protection laws when handling data in different jurisdictions. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes strict requirements on how personal data can be transferred across borders, stored, and accessed. Option A partially explains the concept, but option B is more precise in defining data sovereignty as being regulated by local laws. The other options (C and D) reference security models and network verification strategies, which are unrelated to data sovereignty.
Of the authentication methods listed below, Which one represents the most secure authentication method?;Windows Hello.;Passwords.;Short message service (SMS);Phone call;A;Of the methods listed below, Windows Hello, as a passwordless method of authentication, is the most secure.
Which of the following additional forms of verification can be used with Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication?;Microsoft Authenticator app, SMS, Voice call, FIDO2, and Windows Hello for Business;Security questions, SMS, Voice call, FIDO2, and Windows Hello for Business;Password spray, SMS, Voice call, FIDO2, and Windows Hello for Business;Password, smart card, SMS and Phone Call;A;Indeed, these specific combinarion are all valid forms of verification with multifactor authentication.
A company's IT organization has been asked to find ways to reduce IT costs, without compromising security. Which feature should they consider implementing?;Self-service password reset.;Biometric sign-in on all devices.;FIDO2.;Microsoft Authenticator Push Notification;A;Self-service password reset allows users to change or reset their own passwords, thereby reducing the cost of providing administrators and help desk personnel. In the other hand: FIDO2 may require the purchase of external keys such as a USB device, which might involve additional expense.
What is a benefit of single sign-on?;A central identity provider can be used.;The user signs in once and can then access many applications or resources.;Passwords always expire after 72 days.;Users must sign in multiple times for each application.;B;Single sign-on (SSO) allows a user to sign in once using a central identity provider and then access multiple applications or resources without needing to sign in again. This improves the user experience and reduces the number of passwords that need to be managed. Option D is incorrect because it contradicts the main advantage of SSO, which is reduced sign-ins.
Which relationship allows federated services to access resources?;Claim relationship.;Shared access relationship.;Trust relationship.;Identity federation relationship.;C;Federated services use a trust relationship to grant access to resources. This is a key concept in federated identity management, where two parties establish trust so that users from one organization can access resources in another organization seamlessly. Option D, "Identity federation relationship," sounds plausible but is incorrect terminology in this context.
Authentication is the process of doing what?;Verifying that a user or device is who they say they are.;The process of tracking user behavior.;Enabling federated services.;Managing device permissions across all networks.;A;Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device, ensuring they are who they claim to be. This is the first step in securing systems and services. Option D is incorrect because authentication is not about managing device permissions but about identity verification.
When browsing Microsoft compliance documentation in the Service Trust Portal, you have found several documents that are specific to your industry. What is the best way of ensuring you keep up to date with the latest updates?;Save the documents to your My Library.;Print each document so you can easily refer to them.;Download each document.;Bookmark the page.;A;Saving the document to the My Library section of the Service Trust Portal will ensure you have the latest updates. This feature allows you to access the most recent version of the document directly from the portal. Option D is incorrect because bookmarking the page does not automatically update the content.
Microsoft's approach to privacy is built on six principles: Three of the principles are strong legal protections for privacy, no content-based targeting, and benefits to customers from any data we collect. Identify the three other principles that are part of Microsoft's approach to privacy.;Customer control, transparency, and security.;Shared responsibility, transparency, and security.;Customer control, transparency, and zero trust.;Privacy assurance, security, and transparency.;A;Microsoft's approach to privacy is built on the principles of customer control, transparency, security, strong legal protections for privacy, no content-based targeting, and benefits to customers from any data we collect. Option D is incorrect because it includes "privacy assurance" which is not part of the six core principles.
A company needs to handle inquiries about personal data that they have collected, as per certain privacy regulations. Which Priva solution should they implement?;Priva Privacy Assessments;Priva Consent Management;Priva Subject Rights Requests;Priva Data Discovery;C;Priva Subject Rights Requests is the appropriate solution for handling inquiries related to personal data collected by a company. This feature helps organizations comply with privacy regulations. Option D, "Priva Data Discovery," is not related to handling personal data inquiries.
